# Faculty-Management-System
The Faculty Management System (FMS) is a robust web-based application designed to simplify and centralize the management of faculty-related information within educational institutions. Developed using Django, a popular Python web framework, the system provides a comprehensive solution for administrators to efficiently oversee faculty details, department profiles, and subject data. Faculty information, including Faculty ID, Name, Department, Subjects Taught, Years of Experience, and Salary, can be easily created and maintained through the system. Furthermore, FMS enables the organization of departments with Department ID, Name, and Full Name, streamlining the categorization of faculty members by department. Subject management is another pivotal feature, allowing the addition of subjects with Subject ID, Name, Full Name, and their association with specific departments. The application offers a responsive web interface, facilitating access from various devices, and ensures straightforward navigation between sections such as Home, Faculty, Subjects, and Departments.By leveraging Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), FMS simplifies database interactions, reducing the need for complex SQL queries.FMS serves as a valuable and user-friendly tool for educational administrators, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in the management of vital academic information.
